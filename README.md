This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using a deep learning approach to classify textual data as positive, negative, or neutral. Built with the FastAI library on top of PyTorch, it leverages a pre-trained ResNet architecture to fine-tune on a custom dataset, showcasing the adaptability of computer vision models for text classification via transfer learning. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training with accuracy evaluation, and visualization of results. This project serves as a practical demonstration of applying modern deep learning techniques to real-world natural language processing tasks.
